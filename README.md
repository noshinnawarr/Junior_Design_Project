## ‚öôÔ∏è Supported Tasks

| Task Command       | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `classify`         | Predict object class (e.g., dog/cat, traffic sign) |
| `segment`          | Label each pixel to identify regions/objects |
| `detect`           | Detect and locate objects using bounding boxes |
| `size`             | Estimate the real-world size of an object |
| `digit`            | Recognize handwritten digits and characters |
| `scan`             | Convert photos of documents to scanned format |
| `omr`              | Grade OMR sheets by detecting filled bubbles |
| `track`            | Track a ball‚Äôs motion across video frames |
| `drowsy`           | Detect driver fatigue using eye aspect ratio |
| `fracture`         | Identify bone fractures in medical X-ray images |
